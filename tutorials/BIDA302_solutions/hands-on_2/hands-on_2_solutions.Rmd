# 1. Missing Values



## Your Turn 1.1: Find the `NA` values

`is.na` and `anyNA(x)` functions are logical

What does `is.na(x)` return? 


```{r missing1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

# answer
is.na(x)

```


There are three values in `x`, so three tests--only the second one is `NA`.

What about `anyNA(x)`?

```{r missing2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

```



```{r missing2-solution}
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

# answer
anyNA(x)

# There are three values in `x`, so three tests--only the second one is `NA`

```




What if we put an exclamation mark -- the "not" symbol -- in front of `is.na()`? How does it differ from `is.na()`?

```{r missing3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

```



```{r missing3-solution}
# example
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

!is.na(x)
```


## Calculating with `NA`


Run this code to see what happens when there are `NA` values in a variable, and you try to sum them.

Use `na.rm` within the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of `x`.


```{r missing4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

# example
sum(x)

```



```{r missing4-solution}

# answer
x <- c(1, NA, 3)
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)


```



## Your Turn 1.2: 

First step: review the structure of the `mpg` data set:

```{r missing1_2_1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
mpg
```


Run to create the `displ_class_by_cyl` table:

* group the cars by class and cylinder size, and 

* show the mean displacement (engine size)

```{r missing1_2_2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# summary table - class by cylinder
displ_class_by_cyl <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, cyl) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) %>%
  arrange(desc(displ_mean)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = displ_mean) %>%
  pivot_longer(-class, names_to = "cyl", values_to = "displ_mean")

displ_class_by_cyl

#saveRDS(displ_class_by_cyl, file = "tutorials/BIDA302_solutions/hands-on_2/displ_class_by_cyl.rds")

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#load displ_class_by_cyl table (since the output of one chunk doesn't carry forward)

displ_class_by_cyl <- readRDS(file = "displ_class_by_cyl.rds")


```


Calculate the mean of `displ_mean` -- note that there are `NA` values.

```{r missing1_2_3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
mean(displ_class_by_cyl$displ_mean)


```



```{r missing1_2_3-solution}


# solution
mean(displ_class_by_cyl$displ_mean, na.rm = TRUE)

```


An alternative solution: use a filter with `!na` to remove the records with `NA` values:

```{r missing1_2_4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
displ_class_by_cyl %>%
  summarise(displ_mean_all = mean(displ_mean))
```



```{r missing1_2_4-solution}


# solution
displ_class_by_cyl %>%
  filter(!is.na(displ_mean)) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean_all = mean(displ_mean))

```



## Summarize with `group()` and `ungroup()`


You'll notice in #1.2 that when we summarize `displ_class_by_cyl` it gives the mean values by class, even though we didn't use any grouping variable.

This is because when we ran the code to create the `displ_class_by_cyl` table, we grouped by `class` and `cyl`. Running the `summarise()` function is applied, it removes one level of the grouping (in this case, `cyl`): 

```{r missing1_2_5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

# example
displ_class_by_cyl

displ_class_by_cyl %>%
  filter(!is.na(displ_mean)) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean_all = mean(displ_mean))


```


If you want the mean of all the values, you have to use `ungroup()` before `summarise()`, to "peel off" `class`


```{r missing1_2_6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

# solution
displ_class_by_cyl %>%
  filter(!is.na(displ_mean)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(displ_mean_all = mean(displ_mean))


```


## Take aways

* using functions to identify unknown values (`NA`) in a variable
* finding `NA` values
* removing or avoiding `NA` values in calculations




# 2. Import data


<!--

Can't read a csv file locally!

https://github.com/harris-coding-lab/codinglab/issues/3

-->

## 1. Reading a CSV file

CSV files are very commonly used for storing flat files. They don't have any formatting--just the number or text in the cell.

The package {readr} is designed to make importing these files simple.


(This example comes straight from https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html)

Run this chunk to create an object called `mtcars`, from a CSV file of the same name.

```{r import2_1_1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

# example
mtcars <- read_csv("mtcars.csv")

```

Adding the `cols()` allows us to alter what {readr} has decided for us. For example, we could set the `cyl` variable to be an integer.

```{r import2_1_2, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}
# example
read_csv("mtcars.csv",
         col_types =
           cols(cyl = col_integer())
         )

```


## Your Turn 1.1

Insert an R chunk and rerun the example above, but with the `am` and `gear` variables also set to integer.

```{r import2_1_3, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}

```


```{r import2_1_3-solution}
# solution
read_csv("mtcars.csv",
         col_types = 
           cols(cyl = col_integer(),
                am = col_integer(),
                gear = col_integer())
)

```




The {readr} package allows a lot of control over how the file is read. Of particular utility are 

* `na = ""` -- specify which values you want to be turned into `NA`

* `skip = 0` -- specify how many rows to skip 

* `n_max = Inf` -- the maximum number of records to read


## Your Turn 1.2

Read the first 5 rows of the "mtcars.csv" file.

```{r import2_1_4, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}

```


```{r import2_1_4-solution}
# solution
read_csv("mtcars.csv", 
         n_max = 5)



```






## 2. Reading an Excel file

If anything, Excel files are more common than CSV and other plain-text data files. They seem to multiply like coat hangers in the closet...

And as we see in the article by Karl Broman & Kara Woo, ["Data Organization in Spreadsheets"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989), they can encourage some ways of storing information that makes it hard for us to analyze. Excel files can also contain a wide variety of data format types. {readxl} tries to figure out what's going on, but like {readr}, it allows you to override some of those automatic decisions.


```{r import2_2_1, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}
deaths <- read_excel("data/deaths.xlsx")
deaths
```

What do you notice about the "Date of birth" and "Date of death" columns?



```{r quiz_import_1}
quiz(
  question("What do you notice about the `Date of birth` and `Date of death` columns?",
    answer("It's exactly the same as it was before"),
    answer("The variables (columns) are in different order"),
    answer("There are now `NA` values", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The values in the cells have changed")
  )
)
```



## Your Turn 2.1

Read in the "deaths" file, but use the `range = ` option to specify when to start reading the file:

In this first example, we will define the range as cells A1:B3

```{r import2_2_2, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}
# Example
deaths <- read_excel("deaths.xlsx", 
                     range = "A1:B3")

deaths

```

But we want a bigger area...but drop the first few rows.

```{r import2_2_3, exercise=TRUE, , exercise.eval=FALSE}

```

```{r import2_2_3-solution}
# solution
deaths <- read_excel(
  "deaths.xlsx",
  range = "A5:F15"
)

deaths

```


Use the `skip =` and `n_max =` options to achieve the same thing:

```{r}

# solution
deaths <- read_excel(
  readxl_example("deaths.xlsx"),
  skip = 4,
  n_max = 10
)

deaths


```


## Your Turn 2.2

Excel files often (almost always?) have multiple sheets in them. It's possible to specify which one you want to use with the `sheets = ""` option. You can also use the position number (if you happen to know it). 

Note that if you don't specify the sheet, {readxl} will default to the first one.

The `excel_sheets()` function will tell you the name of the sheets in an Excel file.

```{r}
datasets <- "datasets.xlsx"

excel_sheets(datasets)

# Example
read_excel(datasets, "iris")

```

Now, read in the "mtcars" sheet using the name of the sheet.


```{r}

# Solution
read_excel(datasets, "mtcars")

```

And finally, read in the "quakes" sheet, using the position.

```{r}
# Solution
read_excel(datasets, 4)

```

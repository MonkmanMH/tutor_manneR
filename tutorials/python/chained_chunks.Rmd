```{r even_more_setup}
d <- 3
```

# learnr + reticulate demo

<!-- Create Python variable `a` which reads `d` from R: -->

```{python setupA, exercise.setup = "even_more_setup"}
a = r.d + 2 # 5
```

<!-- Read `a` from Python, and create `b`: -->

```{r setupB, exercise.setup = "setupA"}
b <- py$a + d # 8
```

R exercise that uses `b` (via R and python setup chunks):

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "setupB"}
b + 1 # 9
```

Python exercise using `b` (via R and python setup chunks):
```{python ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "setupB"}
r.b + 1 # 9
```
